Here are the basic rules and techniques for dribbling:\\n\\n**General Rules:**\\n\\n1. **Control the ball**: The primary goal of dribbling is to maintain control of the ball while moving it in different directions.\\n2. **Use the correct body position**: Keep your head up, shoulders relaxed, and knees slightly bent to maintain balance and stability.\\n3. **Keep the ball close**: Keep the ball close to your body to maintain control and prevent it from being stolen.\\n4. **Use different parts of the body**: Use different parts of your body, such as your hands, feet, or head, to control the ball.\\n5. **Dribble with both hands**: In basketball, dribbling with both hands is essential to maintain control and create scoring opportunities.\\n\\n**Soccer Dribbling Rules:**\\n\\n1. **Use the inside, outside, and sole of the foot**: In soccer, dribblers use the inside, outside, and sole of their foot to control the ball.\\n2. **Keep the ball low**: Keep the ball close to the ground to maintain control and prevent it from being intercepted.\\n3. **Use different parts of the foot**: Use different parts of the foot, such as the inside, outside, and sole, to control the ball.\\n4. **Dribble with the laces**: In soccer, dribblers often use the laces (the middle part of the foot) to control the ball.\\n\\n**Basketball Dribbling Rules:**\\n\\n1. **Use the fingertips**: In basketball, dribblers use their fingertips to control the ball.\\n2. **Keep the ball low**: Keep the ball close to the ground to maintain control and prevent it from being intercepted.\\n3. **Use different parts of the hand**: Use different parts of the hand, such as the fingertips, palms, and wrists, to control the ball.\\n4. **Dribble with both hands**: In basketball, dribbling with both hands is essential to maintain control and create scoring opportunities.\\n\\n**Techniques:**\\n\\n1. **Stationary dribbling**: Dribble the ball while standing still to develop control and coordination.\\n2. **Moving dribbling**: Dribble the ball while moving in different directions to develop speed and agility.\\n3. **Crossovers**: Switch the ball from one hand to the other while drib\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 500, 'prompt_tokens': 42, 'total_tokens': 542, 'completion_time': 0.595856542, 'prompt_time': 0.001884035, 'queue_time': 0.005703412, 'total_time': 0.597740577}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_33e8adf159', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--cca78fca-3bed-498a-a31b-0cb40330c502-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 42, 'output_tokens': 500, 'total_tokens': 542}\n"
